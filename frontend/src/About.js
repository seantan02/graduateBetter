  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Graduate Better! This is a web application Sean Tan Siong Ann, and his friend Anton Cheng started.</p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>Our founder, Sean Tan Siong Ann, a current badger sees that in the future this tool can help our fellow badgers to maximize their gain in UW-Madison academically for all the money they pay!</p>

  <h2>Our Founders</h2>
  <p>Sean Tan Siong Ann - Founder</p>
  <p>Sean is a sophomore now in UW-Madison as of 2024 Spring. He majors in Computer Science, Data Science and minoring in Mathematics, and Economics.</p>

  <p>Anton Cheng- Co-Founder</p>
  <p>Anton is a sophomore now in UW-Madison as of 2024 Spring. He majors in Computer Science.</p>

  <h2>How We Started</h2>
  <p>We started because our founder has difficulity figuring out what courses to take in order to obtain all majors he wanted: Computer Science, Data Science. He also knows that doing these 2 majors puts him in a position that with just a few more classes, he will be able to obtain several more majors/minors. Thus, he wishes there is a tool like Graduate Better that can help a freshy figure out what majors they could aim for.</p>
